## Story Time
Hi again, I'm Daniel. I'm 20 and I'm starting my Bachelors Degree in Finance at the sunny Nova SBE.
At this point you may be asking how did I ended up here? _Fair Enough_.
Well, from a young age I learned and liked to work with computers and technology in general.
A few years back I decided that I wanted to go deeper and learn how to code, because it seemed something useful in the future and also it is _kinda cool_ 
because people who don't code will likely think you are either a wizzard or a genius. Also, I liked the dress code of developers :). 

As of today, the Finance student here believes
the younger me was right. The world is going digital. An insane ammount of data is generated every millisecond and decision-making has most likely changed with it. Coding knowledge enables me not only to
be more productive, by automating tasks, but also to comprehend and develop new products, services and business models.

My journey started on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), learning HTML and CSS and while it was useful, it didn't triggered me. It was only in February 2022, when
I joined [PMC](https://github.com/Nova-SBE-Portfolio-Management-Club) that my passion and knowledge went _to the moon_.
On the paper I've been a _Quant_, but on the field I've been a _Quant_, a _Team Leader_, a _System Designer_, a _DB Administrator_ a _UI and UX Manager_, a _PM Assistant_ and
an _IT Manager_. Probably, I was not qualified for half of this but Stack Overflow and Google were there for me. One way or another, I learned, I solved problems along
the way and I guess coding is all about that. It has been an amazing journey and I'm still amazed not only with what I can do, but also about how impressive stuff is done _open source_. I hope to contribute in the future!

At this point you probably understood that I like to write (except for Documentation :/). I'm a lighthearthed, goal-oriented human being with a great sense of humour. I love to talk and colaborate with people.
I'm working on my conciseness though ðŸ˜…. 


Consider this my ```print("hello world")```. Can't wait to hearing back from you!
Daniel
